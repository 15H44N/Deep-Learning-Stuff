# Deep-Learning-Stuff
A collection of my deep learning projects, yet to be updated more regularly.  
Implementations using Frameworks is key for now.

  TF-Keras

The contents, for now are described in a TOC below  
### Contents
#### 1. [Dogs-Cats-CNN](Dogs-Cats-CNN/dogs-cats-cnn.md)
A Basic CNN based Classifier, along with transfer-learned VGG16 model to well, differentiate cats from dogs. Yeah. I know. Duh!
#### 2. [PyTorch Basics](PyTorch Basics/pytorch-basics.md)
This is a subcollection of little notebooks I had been using to learn PyTorch for an upcoming Research Based Project
#### 3. Synthetic Images DCGAN
A simple DCGAN to generate synthetic images. For now it contains only the one for synthetic fashion items.

#### 4: Verbose Notebooks
Some notebooks I had a little too much fun explaining, to no one. :(  
Have a look. I even tried to make little TeX based PDF files  







Again, Why?
