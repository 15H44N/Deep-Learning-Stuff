# Deep-Learning-Stuff
A collection of my deep learning projects, yet to be updated more regularly.
Implementations using Frameworks is key for now.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import torch.nn as nn
print("Let's Get Started!")
```

The contents, for now are described in a TOC below
### Contents
#### 1. [Dogs-Cats-CNN](Dogs-Cats-CNN/dogs-cats-cnn.md)
A Basic CNN based Classifier, along with transfer-learned VGG16 model to well, differentiate cats from dogs. Yeah. I know. Duh!
#### 2. [PyTorch-Basics](PyTorch-Basics/pytorch-basics.md)
This is a subcollection of little notebooks I had been using to learn PyTorch for an upcoming Research Based Project
#### 3. [Coursera-Project-Network-Projects](Coursera-Project-Network-Projects/CPN-projects.md)
This subrepo contains the work done in Guided Projects on Deep Learning from the
Coursera Project Network

#### 4: [Verbose-Notebooks](Verbose-Notebooks/verbose.md)
Some notebooks I had a little too much fun explaining, to no one. :(
Have a look. I even tried to make little TeX based PDF files
Again, Why
